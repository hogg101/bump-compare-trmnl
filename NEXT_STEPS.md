# Next Steps for Bump Compare Plugin

## Todo List

- [ ] Research and ratify the week vs object comparison list - check for official pregnancy comparison lists online for inspiration
- [ ] Create 8-bit style PNG icons for all pregnancy weeks (weeks 0-40)
- [x] Add validation screen/error state when user inputs a due date more than 9 months away (cannot be pregnant)
- [x] Implement pregnancy progress bar to visualize progress through pregnancy
- [x] Add text to say which trimester the user is in based on the week:
    - First trimester: Weeks 0-12
    - Second trimester: Weeks 13-28
    - Third trimester: Weeks 29-40
- [x] Improve the UI, design and font choice:
    - Use an "eclectic type" font in a couple or more sub variations for the sections
    - Utilise the 4 grey capability of the trmnl e ink display
    - Improve sizing and spacing and layout - i think the progress bar should be the lowest item for example
    - Can the progress bar have a pixellated effect and maybe some greyscale?
- [ ] Add a title to the plugin that says "Bump Compare"
- [ ] Fix the UK/US Metric/Imperial switching functionality
- [ ] Add a new shared.liquid file that contains the shared code for the plugin as per the TRMNL docs.
